                   <p> Stop acting like you know. Taxi drivers and bartenders are your consiglieres, your guides. Don’t tell them where you want
                     to go; ask them to point you where you should be. This also applies at restaurants. I gave up menus and entries years ago.
                      Make snacks your friends and simply ask the experts (i.e. people who work there) what you should be eating. 
                      If you already know what you want, then you really didn’t need to leave home in the first place.

Tap your friends (and friends of friends) for advice. Ask people what you should go see. I found all the highlights of this road trip by
following suggestions from locals (some of them strangers, but now friends).Avoid highways: stick to the small roads to soak up real flavour
while you travel. Take care of the people who help you. Everyone at the hotel gets a tip except for the people who make sure your sheets
are clean and your bed is made? Common. Leave a few bucks with a note attached to thank the maids, the most under-appreciated 
(and most important) people there.

Be British. I never thought I’d say that, but one thing the Brits do well is self-deprecation. Be fully prepared to make fun of yourself,
or your home town. There’s nothing worse than a traveller who’s deadest on convincing everyone that they’re not a stereotype.

If you’re a sports fan, watch (and cheer) from your hotel room. Nice as most people might be, there is a line. 
And it usually involves the score.
Stay away from Interstates if you can. A city’s charms lie miles from the fast roads.

Take chances with conversations. Oh sure, we can be reserved back home, but sitting down and talking to people on either side
of you makes for a more authentic experience… or that might be the Okie in me talking.

Write postcards, not emails. Let’s bring back the images that got us wander lusting in the first place. And speaking of bringing things back,
how about classing it up again on airlines? I’m the biggest offender of this rule, refusing to travel in anything but my worn-out yoga pants,
but still. Let’s bring style back to travel.

Take people up on their offers.When someone invites you over to their house, or out to dinner, or on a tour — take them up on it (but be safe).
Heartfelt generosity is the reason I’ve been able to travel so long on so little money.
